@article{Albon1,
	Abstract = {(1) We investigated cohort differences in survival and reproductive
	success of female red deer in an increasing population on the Isle
	of Rhum, Scotland. (2) Juvenile survival and fecundity were density-dependent
	and showed a progressive decline in each successive cohort recruited
	into the population. In contrast, cohort differences in the survival
	of offspring were density-independent. After accounting for the density-dependent
	decline in fecundity, the residual variation of cohorts was concordant
	with the density-independent variation in survival of their offspring.
	(3) Cohort differences in offspring survival were related to variation
	in mean birth weight of offspring born to the cohort. Cohort variation
	in offspring birth weight was correlated with differences in the
	cohort's birth weight. This, in turn, was positively correlated with
	temperature in April and May, the last 2 months of gestation. (4)
	Cohorts born after warm springs were more likely to begin their breeding
	lives early and experienced higher adult survival rates than cohorts
	born after cold springs. (5) The results suggest that early growth
	and development have a permanent effect on reproductive success presumably
	because the prevailing environmental conditions in the first summer
	of life influence adult size. The implications of these density-independent
	effects for population demography and reproductive strategies are
	discussed. 07518 (Ecology environmental biology Wildlife management

	Abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity in microenvironments may provide unique regeneration
	niches for trees and may promote forest diversity. We examined how
	heterogeneity in understory cover, mineral nutrients, and moisture
	and their interactions with canopy gaps contribute to the coexistence
	of three common, co-occurring tree species. We measured survival
	and height growth of 1080 seedlings of Acer rubrum (red maple), Liriodendron
	tulipifera (yellow poplar), and Quercus rubra (red oak) that were
	planted in one of five understory treatments: removal of understory
	vegetation, trenched, trenched plus removal of understory vegetation,
	fertilization, and a control. Understory treatments were replicated
	in 12 paired gap and canopy environments. Survivorship varied among
	species, with Q. rubra having the highest probability of surviving
	beyond the 1135-day experiment (probability = 0.64), followed by
	A. rubrum (probability = 0:27) and L. tulipifera (probability = 0.07).
	Although canopy gaps and understory treatments had large effects
	on survivorship, species survival rankings changed little across
	microenvironments; Q. rubra had the highest survival in all microenvironments.
	In contrast to survival, L. tulipifera had a relative growth rate
	for height that was three times greater than that of A. rubrum and
	Q. rubra in high-resource microenvironments. There was broad overlap
	among species in relative growth rates in the remaining seven microenvironments,
	with no clear top-ranked species. Differences in seedling growth-and
	survival across these 10 microenvironments may contribute to the
	coexistence of two of the three species studied, L. tulipifera and
	Q. rubra, but not A. rubrum. Q. rubra had higher survival than A.
	rubrum and L. tulipifera in all microenvironments, but L. tulipifera
	tended to grow faster than A. rubrum and Q. rubra in high-resource
	microenvironments. Despite the generally poor performance of A. rubrum,
	it was the only surviving species in some quadrats at the end of
	the experiment, indicating that stochastic effects, in conjunction
	with broad niche overlap, may also contribute to species coexistence.
	The importance of stochastic effects will probably increase when
	differential fecundity across these three species is considered because
	the high fecundity of A. rubrum offsets survival and growth disadvantages
	of its seedlings through their greater total abundance. 07502 (Ecology

@article{Benton1,
	Abstract = { Summary 1. It is widely appreciated that complex population dynamics
	are more likely in systems where there is a lag in the density dependence.
	The transmission of maternal environmental conditions to offspring
	phenotype is a potential cause of such a lag. Maternal effects are
	increasingly found to be common in a wide range of organisms, and
	might thus be a frequent cause of nonequilibrium population dynamics.
	2. We show that a maternal effects' lag generally increases population
	variability. This may result from the lag inducing cycles (or more
	complex dynamics) in a deterministic environment or, in a stochastic
	environment, from the lag interacting with environmental noise to
	produce more variable dynamics than would otherwise occur. This may
	happen whether the underlying dynamics are equilibrium, periodic
	or more complex. 3. Although maternal effects may generally destabilize
	dynamics there are a clear set of exceptions to this. For example,
	including a maternal lag may convert cycles to equilibrium dynamics,
	which may revert to cycles when external noise is added. 4. The influence
	of the maternal effect depends importantly on the details of the
	model, whether it is structured or unstructured, the life-history
	traits which are maternally affected, and the type of density dependence.
	5. Our results indicate that, if maternal effects are possible, failure
	to include them in models used predictively may result in quantitatively,
	and perhaps qualitatively, poor predictions. },

	Abstract = {Maternal effects comprise a class of phenotypic effects that parents
	have on phenotypes of their offspring that are unrelated to the offspring's
	own genotype. Although biologists have known about the importance
	of these effects for decades, maternal effects have only recently
	been studied widely by evolutionary ecologists. Moreover, the impact
	of maternal effects on the rate and direction of evolution of other
	components of the phenotype has only recently been fully elucidated
	by theoretical genetic models. This paper provides a brief overview
	of maternal effects research, focusing on research conducted in animal
	systems. First, I review and summarize definitions and theoretical
	treatments of maternal effects. Then I survey the diversity of maternal
	effects and some of the kinds of ecological and evolutionary impacts
	that maternal effects have been shown to have on offsprng performance.
	Third, I discuss some of the ecological and evolutionary implications
	of maternal effects in ecological research. In this context, it is
	argued that the kinds of maternal effects that have been studied,
	and some of the potential implications of maternal effects that have
	not been explored are both artifacts of research effort. Hence, I
	identify several fruitful areas for future maternal effects research.
	Lastly, I describe the necessity of explicitly incorporating maternal
	effects in ecological research, wheter or not the researcher is focusing
	on them as the topic of the research.},

	Abstract = {Much of classical ecological theory is based on the postulate that
	populations consist of identical individuals (Kingsland 1985, McIntosh
	1991). Even though modeling something as complex as ecological systems
	necessitates some rather radical simplifications, this seems at odds
	with the fact that natural and laboratory populations typically exhibit
	large amounts of both genetic and nongenetic variation in life-history
	traits and demographic parameters. One theme in the work on population
	dynamics during the last decade is that individual variation promotes
	stable dynamics (e.g., Begon 1984, Lomnicki 1988). The theoretical
	results are mainly form specific two-dimensional consumer-resources
	systems. The conclusions of variability enhancing stability from
	some of these studies are weakened by the inherent complexity of
	the models. It is not easy to generalize the results of the investigations
	to other forms of individual variation or other systems. In this
	paper we design models that are analogous to the standard deterministic
	one-species models commonly used (e.g., May & Oster 1976, Bellows
	1981) but which include individual variation. We use the models to
	investigate the possibility of making generalizations about the role
	of individual variation in population dynamics.},

	and heterogeneous survival rates. This model constitutes an extension
	of the family of models presented by Brownie et al. (1985, Statistical
	Inference from Band-Recovery Data-A Handbook, 2nd edition, Washington,
	D.C.: Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior). Numerical
	studies of the model under known amounts of heterogeneity investigate
	issues of identifiability, bias, and precision. Additional work under
	time-specific variation in survival rates investigates the properties
	of the estimation procedure. We provide an example and the theoretical
	foundation for extensions to other models in the Brownie et al. (1985)

	Abstract = {(1) The paper investigates the effects of density-dependent changes
	in early development on population dynamics in red deer (Cervus elaphus)
	on Rhum [Scotland]. (2) The survival of calves through their first
	year of life was related to their birth weight and birth date. (3)
	As population density increased, the average date of parturition
	became later. Mean birth weight did not change, but at high density,
	its influence on over-winter calf survival intensified. (4) An extension
	of key factor analysis showed that these two effects were responsible
	for much of the increase in over-winter calf mortality at high population
	density. 04500 (Mathematical biology and statistical methods) [85725

	Abstract = {Leslie (1945) models the evolution in discrete time of a closed, single-sex
	population with discrete age groups by multiplying a vector describing
	the age structure by a matrix containing the birth and death rates.
	We suppose that successive matrices are chosen according to a Markov
	chain from a finite set of matrices. We find exactly the long-run
	rate of growth and expected age structure. We give two approximations
	to the variance in age structure and total population size. A numerical
	example illustrates the ergodic features of the model using Monte
	Carlo simulation, finds the invariant distribution of age structure
	from a linear integral equation, and calculates the moments derived
	here},

@article{Conner1,
	Abstract = {Population viability models are commonly used to estimate the probability
	of persistence of small, threatened, or endangered populations. Demographic,
	temporal, spatial, and individual heterogeneity are important factors
	affecting the probability of persistence of small populations. Because
	stochastic process are intractable analytically (Ludwig [1996]),
	computer simulation models are often used for estimating population
	viability via numerical techniques. Although demographic, spatial,
	and temporal stochasticity have been incorporated into some population
	viability models, individual heterogeneity has not been included.
	In this paper we include individual heterogeneity in a simulation
	model and examine probabilities of population persistence at different
	levels of heterogeneity and population size. Individual heterogeneity
	may increase the probability of persistence of small populations.
	The mechanism for the extension in persistence may be explained by
	natural selection. Genotypes persisting through a decline may be
	those that survive better under the conditions causing the decline.
	These individuals that survive and reproduce in the face of adverse
	conditions may extend the probability that a small population persists.

	Abstract = {Individual humans, and members of diverse other species, show consistent
	differences in aggressiveness, shyness, sociability and activity.
	Such intraspecific differences in behaviour have been widely assumed
	to be non-adaptive variation surrounding (possibly) adaptive population-average
	behaviour. Nevertheless, in keeping with recent calls to apply Darwinian
	reasoning to ever-finer scales of biological variation, we sketch
	the fundamentals of an adaptive theory of consistent individual differences
	in behaviour. Our thesis is based on the notion that such 'personality
	differences' can be selected for if fitness payoffs are dependent
	on both the frequencies with which competing strategies are played
	and an individual's behavioural history. To this end, we review existing
	models that illustrate this and propose a game theoretic approach
	to analyzing personality differences that is both dynamic and state-dependent.
	Our motivation is to provide insights into the evolution and maintenance
	of an apparently common animal trait: personality, which has far
	reaching ecological and evolutionary implications.},

	Abstract = {The costs and limits of phenotypic plasticity are thought to have
	important ecological and evolutionary consequences, yet they are
	not as well understood as the benefits of plasticity. At least nine
	ideas exist regarding how plasticity may be costly or limited, but
	these have rarely been discussed together. The most commonly discussed
	cost is that of maintaining the sensory and regulatory machinery
	needed for plasticity, which may require energy and material expenses.
	A frequently considered limit to the benefit of plasticity is that
	the environmental cues guiding plastic development can be unreliable.
	Such costs and limits have recently been included in theoretical
	models and, perhaps more importantly, relevant empirical studies
	now have emerged. Despite the current interest in costs and limits
	of plasticity, several lines of reasoning suggest that they might
	be difficult to demonstrate.},

	Abstract = {Previous theories on the effective size of age-structured populations
	assumed a constant environment and, usually, a constant population
	size and age structure. We derive formulas for the variance effective
	size of populations subject to fluctuations in age structure and
	total population size produced by a combination of demographic and
	environmental stochasticity. Haploid and monoecious or dioecious
	diploid populations are analyzed. Recent results from stochastic
	demography are employed to derive a two-dimensional diffusion approximation
	for the joint dynamics of the total population size, N, and the frequency
	of a selectively neutral allele, p. The infinitesimal variance for
	p, multiplied by the generation time, yields an expression for the
	effective population size per generation. This depends on the current
	value of N, the generation time, demographic stochasticity, and genetic
	stochasticity due to Mendelian segregation, but is independent of
	environmental stochasticity. A formula for the effective population
	size over longer time intervals incorporates deterministic growth
	and environmental stochasticity to account for changes in N.},

	Abstract = {The demographic variance of an age-structured population is defined.
	This parameter is further split into components generated by demographic
	stochasticity in each vital rate. The applicability of these parameters
	are investigated by checking how an age-structured population process
	can be approximated by a diffusion with only three parameters. These
	are the deterministic growth rate computed from the expected projection
	matrix and the environmental and demographic variances. We also consider
	age-structured populations where the fecundity at any stage is either
	zero or one, and there is neither environmental stochasticity nor
	dependence between individual fecundity and survival. In this case
	the demographic variance is uniquely determined by the vital rates
	defining the projection matrix. The demographic variance for a long-lived
	bird species, the wandering albatross in the southwestern part of
	the Indian Ocean, is estimated. We also compute estimates of the
	age-specific contributions to the total demographic variance from
	survival, fecundity and the covariance between survival and fecundity.},

	Abstract = {We offer an evaluation of the Caughley and Krebs hypothesis that small
	mammals are more likely than large mammals to possess intrinsic population
	regulating mechanisms. Based on the assumption that intrinsic regulation
	will be manifest via direct density-dependent feedbacks, and extrinsic
	regulation via delayed density-dependent feedbacks, we fit autoregressive
	models to 30 time series of abundance for large and small mammals
	to characterize their dynamics. Delayed feedbacks characterizing
	extrinsic mechanisms, such as trophic-level interactions, were detected
	in most time series, including both small and large mammals. Spectral
	analyses indicated that the effect of such delayed feedbacks on the
	variability in population growth rates differed with body size, with
	large mammals exhibiting predominantly reddened and whitened spectra
	in contrast with predominantly blue spectra for small mammals. Large
	mammals showed less variance and more stable dynamics than small
	mammals, consistent with, among other factors, differences in their
	potential population growth rates. Patterns of population dynamics
	in small versus large mammals contradicted those predicted by the
	Caughley and Krebs hypothesis.},

	Abstract = {1. Density-dependent and climatic conditions experienced by individuals
	before and after birth differ considerably between cohorts. Such
	early environmental variability has the potential to create persistent
	fitness differences among cohorts. Here we test the hypothesis that
	conditions experienced by individuals in their early development
	will have long-term effects on their life history traits. 2. We approached
	this by analysing and contrasting the effects of climate (the North
	Atlantic Oscillation, NAO) and population density at year of birth
	on cohort birth weight, birth date, litter size, age of maturity,
	survival and fecundity of Soay sheep, Ovies aries L., ewes in the
	population on the island of Hirta, St Kilda, Scotland. 3. Significant
	intercohort variations were found in life history traits. Cohorts
	born after warm, wet and windy (high NAO) winters were lighter at
	birth, born earlier, less likely to have a twin and matured later
	than cohorts born following cold and dry (low NAO) winters. High
	population densities in the winter preceding birth also had a negative
	effect on birth weight, birth date and litter size, whereas high
	postnatal densities delayed age of first reproduction. 4. High NAO
	winters preceding birth depressed juvenile survival but increased
	adult survival and fecundity. The negative influence of high NAO
	winters on juvenile survival is likely to be related to mothers'
	compromised physical condition while the cohort is in utero, whereas
	the positive influence on adult survival and fecundity may relate
	to the improved postnatal forage conditions following high NAO winters.
	High pre-and postnatal population densities decreased juvenile (neonatal,
	yearling) and adult (2-4 years) survivorship but had no significant
	effect fecundity. 07508 (Ecology environmental biology Animal) [85715

@article{Fox3,
	Abstract = {The extinction of small populations is a stochastic process, affected
	by both environmental variation and chance variation in the fates
	of individuals (demographic stochasticity). Here I examine how population
	extinction risk is affected by variation in the underlying individual
	phenotypes, using a branching-process approach. I define the long-term
	individual extinction risk as the chance of ultimately leaving no
	descendants, and the cumulative individual extinction risk as the
	chance of leaving no descendants by a specified time. I use these
	to show that if there is a phenotypic correlation between parents
	and their offspring, variation in these quantities always reduces
	both the long- and short-term population extinction risk. Such variation
	in individual extinction risk arises from individual variation in
	demographic parameters and may have both genetic and environmental
	causes. Using a well-known approximation of the difference between
	the log arithmetic and log geometric means, I derive expressions
	for the sensitivity and elasticity of the approximate log extinction
	risk to changes in the mean and variance of the individual extinction
	risk, and, to changes in population size. One conclusion is that
	increasing the variance among individuals in extinction risk can
	sometimes be at least as important in reducing population extinction
	risk as increasing,the population size itself. These analyses also
	point to reasons why changes in environmental factors (e.g., toxicants)
	or management practices may have either larger or smaller effects
	than would be anticipated by considering the change in the mean risk
	alone.},

@article{Fox1,
	Abstract = {Demographic stochasticity is almost universally modeled as sampling
	variance in a homogeneous population, although it is defined as arising
	from random variation among individuals. This can lead to serious
	misestimation of the extinction risk in small populations. Here,
	we derive analytical expressions showing that the misestimation for
	each demographic parameter is exactly (in the case of survival) or
	approximately (in the case of fecundity) proportional to the among-individual
	variance in that parameter. We also show why this misestimation depends
	on systematic variation among individuals, rather than random variation.
	These results indicate that correctly assessing the importance of
	demographic stochasticity requires (1) an estimate of the variance
	in each demographic parameter; (2) information on the qualitative
	shape (convex or concave) of the meanvariance relationship; and
	(3) information on the mechanisms generating among-individual variation.
	An important consequence is that almost all population viability
	analyses (PVAs) overestimate the importance of demographic stochasticity
	and, therefore, the risk of extinction.},

	Abstract = {A Markov model is presented for population growth under "demographic
	stochasticity", wherein each individual undergoes birth and death
	events independently of other individuals in the population. This
	approach more faithfully represents the true biological time scales
	of the process; it permits the analysis of skewed distributions of
	per-individual change, such as clutch size greater than 1; and it
	permits the calculation of a number of statistics to describe the
	behavior of the process, e.g. a cumulative distribution for times
	to extinction. Endangered species (e.g. grizzly bears and desert
	tortoises) with large clutch (litter) sizes and low growth are especially
	vulnerable to this form of stochastic extinction},

@article{Gustafsson1,
	Abstract = {It has often been suggested that sexual selection may have important
	consequences for life-history evolution and vice versa. We manipulated
	the parental effort of male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis)
	by changing the number of offspring in their nests and found a trade-off
	between parental effort and the size of the male's forehead patch
	(a secondary sexual character) in the following year. We report here
	that, in addition to this intra-generational trade-off, we found
	an inter-generational trade-off: the size of the forehead patch in
	first-year males was negatively related to the change in brood size
	of the nest in which they were raised. This has consequences for
	reproductive success because males with large patches mate with more
	females and have higher lifetime reproductive success. To our knowledge,
	this is the first experimental demonstration that life-history traits
	and secondary sexual characters trade off against each other. Our
	results support the suggestion that the life-history consequences
	of sexual ornaments are important in their evolution2-},

@article{Hastings1,
	Abstract = { 1. Maternal and birth colony effects on offspring survival to weaning
	and to reproductive age were examined for Weddell seals using mark-recapture
	models and over 25 years of mark-resight data from McMurdo Sound,
	Antarctica. 2. Pre-weaning mortality (proportion of the total pups
	found dead on the ice surface) varied significantly with maternal
	age and was significantly higher for primiparous mothers than for
	multiparous mothers. 3. Offspring survival to reproductive age also
	increased significantly with maternal age and experience. Survival
	of offspring from birth to 6 years of age increased significantly
	with maternal body length only for male offspring. 4. Increased survivorship
	of offspring with maternal age was only evident for offspring of
	multiparous (rather than primiparous) mothers. This suggests that
	the age when mothers have their first pup may not affect survival
	of offspring, although lack of effect of age on offspring survival
	for primiparous mothers may be due to insufficient variation in age
	of first reproduction in our sample for us to detect a trend. 5.
	Pre-weaning survival of offspring also varied significantly among
	pupping colonies. In 1983, a year of low reproduction and low first-year
	survival for the McMurdo population (Testa 1987b; Hastings 1996),
	first-year survival was lower for offspring born in Outer Erebus
	Bay (west of 166.7oE) than for offspring born in Inner Erebus Bay
	(east of 166.7oE). 6. Maternal effects on offspring survival may
	be related to quality of breeding site. Maternal age and experience
	varied significantly among pupping colonies. That pup population
	size was stable at all colonies over the study period suggests non-random
	age-distribution of mothers may not be an artefact of population
	growth, but instead result from intraspecific competition for space
	in good pupping colonies. 7. Offspring survival, pup population size,
	and mean maternal age at colonies were significantly positively correlated.
	This suggests that favourable environmental conditions and high maternal
	or paternal quality may interact to enhance survival of offspring
	at larger colonies. },

	variation in the age at maturation. This study examines the consequences
	of model assumptions about individual variation in the age at maturation
	on predicted population viability. I considered: (1) the effects
	of variation in age at maturation alone; (2) the effects of heritability;
	and (3) the influence of a stable and an altered selective regime.
	Two selective regimes represented conditions before and after the
	impoundment of a river, blocking access of anadromous white sturgeon
	populations to the ocean. In contrast to previous simulation studies,
	I found that increased individual variation in the age at maturity
	did not necessarily lead to a higher likelihood of persistence. Individual
	variation increased the simulated likelihood of persistence when
	the variation was heritable and the selective regime had changed
	such that the mean age at maturity was no longer optimal.},

	Abstract = {Presence of phenotypic variation is necessary for selection to occur,
	yet processes affecting variation in sexually selected characters
	in natural populations are poorly understood. Here we examine whether
	variation in a sexual ornament (badge size) of male house sparrows
	(Passer domesticus ) is dependent on individual variation in the
	conditions during early ontogenetic stages, and whether this variation
	and the population-wide effects of external variables such as weather
	or population size jointly will generate consistent differences among
	cohorts later in life. Variation in badge size was independent of
	adult body size, whereas heavier fledglings and fledglings in good
	body condition developed smaller visible badges as adults. Furthermore,
	strong cohort-effects were present, caused by a combined effect of
	density-dependence and weather during the early development in the
	moulting period and autumn after hatching. Thus, badge size is an
	environmentally-dependent trait in house sparrows, and likely to
	be under the influence of both natural and sexual selection.},

@article{Kareiva1,
	Abstract = {Population dynamics and species interactions are spread out in space.
	This might seem like a trivial observation, but it has potentially
	important consequences. In particular, mathematical models show that
	the dynamics of populations can be altered fundamentally simply becuase
	organisms interact and disperse rather than being confined to one
	position for their entire lives. Models that deal with dispersal
	and spatially distributed populations are extraordinarily varied,
	partly because they employ three distinct characterizations of space:
	as 'islands' (or 'metapopulations'), as 'stepping-stones', or as
	a continuum. Moreover, there are several different ways of representing
	dispersal in spatially structured environments, as well as several
	possibilities for allowing environmental variation to come into play.
	In spite of this variety, a few common themes emerge from spatial
	models. First, island and stepping-stone models emphasize that little
	can be concluded from simply recording patterns of occupancy, instead
	a metapopulation's fate will be determined by the balance between
	local extinction and recolonization and how that balance interacts
	with random catastrophes. Island and stepping-stone models also make
	it clear that the spatial dimension, in particular spatial subdivision,
	can alter the stability of species interactions and opportunities
	for coexistence in both predator-prey and competitive systems. Continuum
	models, which usually take the form of reaction-diffusion equations,
	address slightly different questions. Reaction-diffusion theory suggests
	that in uniform environments, certain combinations of local dynamics
	and dispersal can produce persistent irregularities in the dispersion
	of species. These striking spatial patterns, which are called diffusive
	instabilities, can arise from predator-prey interactions, Lotka-Volterra
	competitive interactions, and from density-dependent population growth
	in an age-structured population. Moreover, although they differ fundamentally
	in their structure, the three major classes of spatial models share
	the common generalization that spatial effects should be expected
	only for: (i) selected spatial scales; (ii) specific dispersal rates,
	and (iii) particular patterns of environmental variation relative
	to the frequency and ranged of dispersal. The theoretical possibilities
	are thus contingent on spatial scale and dispersal rates. Although
	explicit experimental tests of spatial models are non-existent, a
	handful of studies report general changes in species interactions
	associated with manipulations of habitat subdivision. Observational
	studies with adequate data concerning dispersal and scale are also
	scarce: but those few observational studies with the appropriate
	supporting information consistently show profound spatial effects,
	especially effects due to habitat subdivision. The challenge for
	empiricists is to investigate more rigorously the roles of spatial
	subdivision and dispersal in natural communities. The challenge for
	theoreticians is to make the empiricist's job easier; this can best
	be done by delineating when spatial effects are most likely to be
	influential, and by offering guidance on how to design appropriate
	experiments. Simply saying that the spatial environment is important
	is to mouth a platitude: what we need to know is whether this presumed
	importance amounts to much in natural systems. 03509 (Genetics Population

	Abstract = { Abstract: Population viability analysis ( PVA) is a technique that
	employs stochastic demographic models to predict extinction risk.
	All else being equal, higher variance in a demographic rate leads
	to a greater extinction risk. Demographic stochasticity represents
	variance due to differences among individuals. Current implementations
	of PVAs, however, assume that the expected fates of all individuals
	are identical. For example, demographic stochasticity in survival
	is modeled as a random draw from a binomial distribution. We developed
	a simple conceptual model showing that if there is variation among
	individuals in expected survival, then existing PVA models overestimate
	the variance due to demographic stochasticity in survival. This is
	a consequence of Jensen's inequality and the fact that the binomial
	demographic variance is a concave function of mean survival. The
	effect of variation among individuals on demographic stochasticity
	in fecundity depends on the mean-variance relationship for individual
	reproductive success, which is not presently known. If fecundity
	patterns mirror those of survival, then variation among individuals
	will reduce the extinction risk of small populations. Variacion entre
	Individuos y Estocasticidad Demografica Reducida Resumen: El analisis
	de viabilidad poblacional (AVP) es un tecnica que emplea modelos
	demograficos estocasticos para predecir el riesgo de extincion. Todo
	lo demas siendo igual, mayor variacion en la tendencia demografica
	conduce a un mayor riesgo de extincion. La estocasticidad demografica
	representa variacion debido a diferencias entre individuos. Sin embargo,
	los AVP actualmente asumen que el destino esperado para cada individuo
	es identico. Por ejemplo, la estocasticidad demografica en la supervivencia
	es modelada como una muestra aleatoria de una distribucion binomial.
	Desarrollamos un modelo conceptual simple que muestra que si hay
	variacion entre individuos en la supervivencia esperada, entonces
	los modelos de AVP existentes sobrestiman la variacion debida a la
	estocasticidad demografica en la supervivencia. Esto es una consecuencia
	de la desigualdad de Jensen y del hecho de que la variacion demografica
	binomial es una funcion concava de la supervivencia promedio. El
	efecto de la variacion entre individuos sobre la estocasticidad demografica
	en la fecundidad depende de la relacion media-varianza del exito
	reproductivo individual, que actualmente es desconocida. Si los patrones
	de fecundidad son un reflejo de los de supervivencia, entonces la
	variacion entre individuos reducira el riesgo de extincion de poblaciones
	pequenas. },

@article{Kendall2,
	Abstract = {Spatial extent can have two important consequences for population
	dynamics: It can generate spatial structure, in which individuals
	interact more intensely with neighbors than with more distant conspecifics,
	and it allows for environmental heterogeneity, in which habitat quality
	varies spatially. Studies of these features are difficult to interpret
	because the models are complex and sometimes idiosyncratic. Here
	we analyze one of the simplest possible spatial population models,
	to understand the mathematical basis for the observed patterns: two
	patches coupled by dispersal, with dynamics in each patch governed
	by the logistic map. With suitable choices of parameters, this model
	can represent spatial structure, environmental heterogeneity, or
	both in combination. We synthesize previous work and new analyses
	on this model, with two goals: to provide a comprehensive baseline
	to aid our understanding of more complex spatial models, and to generate
	predictions about the effects of spatial structure and environmental
	heterogeneity on population dynamics. Spatial structure alone can
	generate positive, negative, or zero spatial correlations between
	patches when dispersal rates are high, medium, or low relative to
	the complexity of the local dynamics. It can also lead to quasiperiodicity
	and hyperchaos, which are not present in the nonspatial model. With
	density-independent dispersal, spatial structure cannot destabilize
	equilibria or periodic orbits that would be stable in the absence
	of space. When densities in the two patches are uncorrelated, the
	probability that the population in a patch reaches extreme low densities

@article{Kokko1,
	Abstract = {Field studies of many vertebrates show that some individuals (floaters)
	do not defend territories even when there is space for them to do
	so. We show that the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for the
	threshold territory quality at which floating takes place is that
	which maximizes the size of the floating population (but not the
	total population, breeding population, or reproductive output). The
	ESS is solved separately for two assumptions: whether individuals
	wait to occupy a single territory or multiple territories and whether
	queuing rules are strict or if all waiting individuals are equally
	likely to obtain the next territory. The four combinations of these
	assumptions all give the same evolutionarily stable population size
	of both floaters and breeders. At the ESS, only territories with
	expected lifetime reproductive success (LRS) exceeding 1 should be
	occupied, which introduces a limit to ideal habitat selection. The
	behavioral decision to float alters the shape of the density-dependent
	response, reduces the equilibrium population size, and affects the
	response of the population to habitat loss. Specifically, the floater:
	breeder ratio is directly related to average breeding habitat quality,
	and the floater population size will decrease more than the breeding
	population size if better than average quality habitat is},

	Abstract = { Maternal effects can significantly impact offspring performance.
	Provisioning of offspring with energy stores can quantitatively alter
	their growth rates, survivorship, and future fecundity, and influence
	population regulatory mechanisms. In this paper, we show that maternal
	effects can also qualitatively affect offspring reproduction (i.e.
	their mode of reproduction). The freshwater herbivore Daphnia pulex
	can change the amount of energy allocated between asexual and ephippial
	egg production. Our experiments on individuals, experiencing "step-up"
	or "step-down" food manipulations, reveal that offspring qualitatively
	shift their energy allocation away from asexual reproduction to ephippial
	egg production when there is a simple mismatch between maternal and
	offspring food environments. We show that the response is asymmetric
	with respect to changes in food level, ephippial egg production is
	higher with a greater mismatch between environments, and that the
	effect can be observed in dynamic experimental populations. These
	results point to a "generational memory" that could challenge our
	interpretation of field patterns and mechanisms influencing population
	dynamics in Daphnia-algal systems. },

@article{Lande1,
	Abstract = {Stochastic factors affecting the demography of a single population
	are analyzed to determine the relative risks of extinction from demographic
	stochasticity, environmental stochasticity, and random catastrophes.
	Relative risks are assessed by comparing asymptotic scaling relationships
	describing how the average time to extinction, T, increases with
	the carrying capacity of a population, K, under each stochastic factor
	alone. Stochastic factors are added to a simple model of exponential
	growth up to K. A critical parameter affecting the extinction dynamics
	is hivin r, the tong-run growth rate of a population below K, including
	stochastic factors. If hivin r is positive, with demographic stochasticity
	T increases asymptotically as a nearly exponential function of K,
	and with either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes
	T increases asymptotically as a power of K. If hivin r is negative,
	under any stochastic demographic factor, T increases asymptotically
	with the logarithm of K. Thus. for sufficiently large populations,
	the risk of extinction from demographic stochasticity is less important
	than that from either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes.
	The relative risks of extinction from environmental stochasticity
	and random catastrophes depend on the mean and environmental variance
	of population growth rate, and the magnitude and frequency of catastrophes.
	Contrary to previous assertions in the literature, a population of
	modest size subject to environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes
	can persist for a long time, if DB+r is substantially positive. 00512

@article{Lande3,
	Abstract = {For populations with a density-dependent life history reproducing
	at discrete annual intervals, we analyze small or moderate fluctuations
	in population size around a stable equilibrium, which is applicable
	to many vertebrate populations. Using a life history having age at
	maturity , with stochasticity and density dependence in adult recruitment
	and mortality, we derive a linearized autoregressive equation with
	time lags from 1 to yr. Contrary to current interpretations, the
	coefficients corresponding to different time lags in the autoregressive
	dynamics are not simply measures of delayed density dependence but
	also depend on life-history parameters. The theory indicates that
	the total density dependence in a life history, D, should be defined
	as the negative elasticity of population growth rate per generation
	with respect to change in population size, D=-lnT/lnN, where is the
	asymptotic multiplicative growth rate per year, T is the generation
	time, and N is adult population size. The total density dependence
	in the life history, D, can be estimated from the sum of the autoregression
	coefficients. We estimate D in populations of seven vertebrate species
	for which life-history studies and unusually long time series of
	complete population censuses are available. Estimates of D were statistically
	significant and large, on the order of 1 or higher, indicating strong
	density dependence in five of the seven species. We also show that
	life history can explain the qualitative features of population autocorrelation
	functions and power spectra and observations of increasing empirical
	variance in population size with increasing length of time series.},

	Abstract = {1 Following severe, stand-replacing fires in 1995, we quantified emergence,
	growth and survival in Pinus rigida seedlings in eight stands in
	three areas of the pine barrens of Long Island, New York, USA, and
	examined factors contributing to spatial and temporal variation in
	recruitment.2 We followed 6431 marked seedlings in the first cohort
	following fire, as well as additional cohorts in subsequent years,
	for 7 years to assess the effects of fire intensity, soil characteristics,
	intraspecific density, interspecific competition and facilitation
	on variation in early demography at three different scales. We found
	substantial variation in many of the demographic parameters measured
	between plots within stands (10-50 m apart), among stands within
	areas (600-1500 m apart), and among forest areas (5-30 km apart),
	as well as among years.3 Almost all adult P. rigida in most of the
	stands studied were killed by the 1995 fires and population recovery
	therefore depended upon recruitment from seed. Initial recruitment
	appears to be largely determined by seed limitation, which was affected
	by fire intensity combined with serotiny and other factors.4 Subsequent
	seedling survival and growth were determined largely by inherent
	differences among areas and sites in factors including cover of the
	shrub Quercus ilicifolia and soil texture and composition.5 Initial
	seedling density, and subsequent survival and growth, varied among
	plots within sites, among sites within areas, and among areas. Early
	survival was negatively correlated with intraspecific seedling density,
	but was enhanced by neighbouring Q. ilicifolia, although these shrubs
	inhibited later seedling growth. Early demographic variation may
	determine many of the differences observed among mature populations
	in this landscape.6 Variation in demographic parameters across space
	and time, and over a hierarchy of scales, may have critical consequences
	at the population, community and landscape levels. A comprehensive
	evaluation of the nature and extent of such demographic variation
	across different systems would have major implications for understanding
	vegetation patterns at the population, community and landscape levels.

@article{Lawton1,
	Abstract = {(1) We surveyed the distribution of water voles (Arvicola terrestris)
	every month at thirty-nine sites on rivers in the North Yorkshire
	Moors National Park [UK] for 2 years (1985 and 1986). Detailed studies
	continued at a small number of selected sites until 1989. Sites were
	sections of river bank 100-300 m long, the distance typically occupied
	by discrete breeding colonies of voles in this area. (2) In the main
	survey period (1985 and 1986) we found ten 'core sites' with breeding
	colonies of voles. A further fifteen sites were classified as 'peripheral'
	(visited by voles, but lacking breeding colonies). We found no evidence
	that water voles ever visited or used the remaining fourteen sites.
	(3) Data on bankside vegetation, bank angles, human disturbance,
	and grazing regimes by domestic stock were used in principal component
	analysis to classify habitat characteristics associated with core,
	peripheral and other sites. (4) Core sites were closely grouped in
	principal component space, and were characterized by a high percentage
	of grass, steep bank angles, and relatively high layering of the
	vegetation. These characteristics are readily interpreted in terms
	of water vole biology. (5) On the basis of habitat characteristics,
	we identified a further twelve unoccupied or peripheral sites that
	should have been suitable for breeding water voles. All these sites
	were more isolated and/or suffered much higher predation by mink
	(Mustela vison) than core sites. We also observed the extermination
	of two former core sites as mink invaded the area between 1987 and
	1989. (6) We conclude that there are gaps in the distribution of
	the water vole because some habitats are unsuitable (approximately
	45% of sites) and of sites with suitable habitat, about 30% lack
	water voles because they are too isolated (reducing colonization
	rates) and/or suffer very high levels of mink predation (increasing
	extinction rates). The conservation implications of these results
	are briefly discussed. 00512 (General biology Conservation and resource

	Abstract = {The earliest matrix models, proposed in the 1940s, consider age classes,
	and were later proved to be equivalent to the discrete time version
	of the stable population theory. In this theory and models, besides
	the asymptotic growth rate, a very important characteristic is the
	turnover of individuals, measured in various ways by generation time.
	Models considering stages, on the contrary, do not take into account
	the age of individuals and seem largely preferable to age-structured
	models for many populations in which demographic characteristics
	are related to biological stages (such a seed, rosette, flowering
	plant, etc.) rather than to age per itself. These two kinds of models
	can be embedded as particular cases of stage by age models or multistate
	models. Theses general models can be used to develop a multistate
	stable population theory with many advantages. This general theory
	is reviewed with emphasis on general rules for sensitivity analyses
	in which generation time plays a central role. },

	need for clear distinctions between individual variation, skewness,

	since these concepts are fundamental to understanding population
	stability. A brief critical evaluation of the importance of chaotic
	population dynamics is also given. A criticism of individual-based

@article{Lomnicki2,
	Abstract = {A model of population regulation by emigration is developed based
	on spatial and temporal heterogeneity of natural environments and
	unequal resource partitioning among individuals of single species
	populations. This latter phenomenon was not previously taken into
	account by theoretical ecologists, although it is of basic importance
	for regulation of population density. Unequal resource partitioning
	increases the stability of a confined population and allows emigration
	of some population members into suboptimal and hostile areas to evolve
	by individual selection. In a local habitat supplied by a constant
	inflow of food, animal density is lower and food density higher when
	emigration occurs than without emigration. Regulation of population
	density by emigration allows for the adjustment of this density to
	the amount of food, in such a way that mortality is not directly
	due to food shortage but to other agents (predators, adverse weather
	conditions, etc.). Animals with overlapping generations and cyclic
	changes in population density can emigrate at lower density level
	than that determined by food supply at any given point in time. At
	high densities such populations can also exhibit reduced reproduction,
	which under certain circumstances can be considered as an adaptation.
	Population outbreaks are thought of as a failure of population regulation
	by emigration resulting from spatial homogeneity of the environment.
	Homogeneity diminishes differences among individuals in local populations
	and differences between local habitats and their surroundings; these
	in turn can make regulation by emigration impossible. 04500 (Mathematical

@article{McNamara2,
	Abstract = {I consider how adaptive changes in behaviour with population size
	affect the stability of the population dynamics. In any given year
	the behavioural rule of a member of a single-species population is
	determined by the value of a certain trait. I allow for the possibility
	that this trait value can change from year to year. The number of
	descendants left in one year's time by an individual depends on its
	trait value, the values of other population members and the population
	size. The population dynamics is modelled as the change in population
	size from one year to the next. I focus on a population that is at
	a fixed point of the dynamics and in which members adopt the evolutionarily
	stable trait value for that equilibrium size. I compare the stability
	of the population dynamics under the following two assumptions about
	the dependence of trait values on population size: (i) trait values
	do not change from that at the equilibrium size, and (ii) trait values
	change so as to be evolutionarily stable for the current size. In
	a range of examples, I show that adaptive behaviour tends to destabilize
	population dynamics in the sense that stability under assumption
	(ii) implies stability under assumption (i). In other words, the
	region of parameter space for whivh there is instability under an
	adaptive response contains the region of instability under no response.
	Various equivalent general criteria for this to hold are given.},

	Abstract = {I consider the problem of characterizing the optimal plastic response
	when there are large-scale fluctuations in the environment affecting
	all population members. Individuals differ in their state, and each
	makes a reproductive decision before the environmental conditions
	are known. An individual's state, its decision, and environmental
	conditions together determine the number of descendants left at the
	next decision epoch. I restrict attention to the simple problem in
	which the state of the descendants left at this epoch does not depend
	on these three factors. Because the environment is fluctuating, there
	is no individual optimization; instead the best action in one state
	implicitly depends on the best action in other states. I characterize
	an optimal state-dependent strategy, give a method of computation,
	and show how behavior of each individual following the optimal strategy
	may be reinterpreted as a form of "individual optimization." Concepts
	are illustrated with an example of optimal clutch size as a function
	of territory quality.},

	Abstract = {Territorial behavior is expected to buffer populations against short-term
	environmental perturbations, but we have found that group living
	in African lions causes a complex response to long-term ecological
	change. Despite numerous gradual changes in prey availability and
	vegetative cover, regional populations of Serengeti lions remained
	stable for 10- to 20-year periods and only shifted to new equilibria
	in sudden leaps. Although gradually improving environmental conditions
	provided sufficient resources to permit the subdivision of preexisting
	territories, regional lion populations did not expand until short-term
	conditions supplied enough prey to generate large cohorts of surviving
	young. The results of a simulation model show that the observed pattern
	of "saltatory equilibria" results from the lions' grouping behavior.

@article{Pen1,
	Abstract = {This is a response to a recent article by Hanna Kokko and William
	J. Sutherland (American Naturalist 152:354-366), who consider evolutionarily
	stable territory acceptance rules for animals that face the decision
	between settling on a poor territory now (which is then retained
	for life) or waiting for better habitat to become available later
	(taking a chance of dying before reproducing). In contrast to these
	authors, we argue that the evolutionarily stable threshold quality
	above which territories are acceptable does depend on whether individuals
	compete for a single territory (queuing) or for multiple territories
	(floating) and also on whether access to territories is determined
	by a hierarchy among waiting individuals. More specifically, we show
	the following: First, if the choice is between floating and settling,
	the evolutionarily stable acceptance threshold is such that threshold
	territories yield an expected lifetime reproductive success (LRS)
	of 1 - muF, the survival probability of a floater. Second, if the
	choice is between queuing and settling, the evolutionarily stable
	threshold may correspond to any LRS between 1 - muF and unity. Third,
	the number of nonbreeding individuals in the population is maximized
	at a threshold of unity. In other words, the evolutionarily stable
	threshold does not maximize the nonbreeding fraction of the population.
	We argue that models of territory choice should carefully specify
	the mechanism of choice because some choice processes (e.g., indiscriminate
	habitat use above the threshold) do not admit an evolutionarily stable
	acceptance rule.},

	Abstract = {Populations are characterized by variability among individuals, a
	result of both intrinsic differences among individuals and environmental
	effects on individual per- formance. Despite the ubiquity of individual
	variation, its implications for population model choice are not fully
	understood. Population models that use state variables representing
	individual features such as age or size assume that these state variables
	can predict the population trajector y. However, state variables
	are often chosen based on convenience or necessity; only rarely are
	they tested for importance and accuracy when individuals var y. We
	examined whether matrix projection models, a common choice in population
	modeling, provide accurate predictions when individuals var y in
	a population. With both density- dependent and density-independent
	formulations, we tested whether matrix projection mod- els that used
	size as a state variable captured the dynamics of populations projected
	with an individual-based simulation (or i-state configuration model).
	We varied the initial size distribution of individuals, the degree
	to which individual growth was size dependent, the tendency for positive
	correlations in growth through time, and the amount of stochasticity
	in growth, and we asked what conditions affect the accuracy of matrix
	models. Stochasticity alone did not compromise the predictions of
	matrix models; rather, only populations with individual variation
	generated by strong size-dependent growth and growth correlations
	were poorly described by matrix models. Other wise, matrix models
	captured the trajectories of populations with a fair degree of accuracy.
	Overall, our results provide guidance as to when and how individual
	variation must be included in population projections, and when a
	simple matrix model framework is inadequate. },

	Abstract = {Although empirical and theoretical studies suggest that climate influences
	the timing of life-history events in animals and plants, correlations
	between climate and the timing of events such as egg-laying, migration
	or flowering do not reveal the mechanisms by which natural selection
	operates on life-history events. We present a general autoregressive
	model of the timing of life-history events in relation to variation
	in global climate that, like autoregressive models of population
	dynamics, allows for a more mechanistic understanding of the roles
	of climate, resources and competition. We applied the model to data
	on 50 years of annual dates of first flowering by three species of
	plants in 26 populations covering 4degree of latitude in Norway.
	In agreement with earlier studies, plants in most populations and
	all three species bloomed earlier following warmer winters. Moreover,
	our model revealed that earlier blooming reflected increasing influences
	of resources and density-dependent population limitation under climatic
	warming. The insights available from the application of this model
	to phenological data in other taxa will contribute to our understanding
	of the roles of endogenous versus exogenous processes in the evolution
	of the timing of life-history events in a changing climate.},

	Abstract = {One important question in ecology is how large-scale regional phenomena
	affect the demography and dynamics of local populations. The purpose
	of the present study was to examine how climate affected spatial
	and temporal variation in demography within an insular metapopulation
	of House Sparrows (Passer domesticus). Daily weather conditions during
	the breeding season were highly correlated within the study region,
	and because the onset of breeding differed significantly among the
	five study islands, fledgling success was also affected. Thus, local
	recruitment was reduced by the occurrence of bad weather during the
	nestling period, and the asynchronous breeding phenology among the
	islands led to a significant island x year interaction in recruitment
	rate. Interaction between climate and the local environment provides
	a mechanism by which spatial synchrony in population dynamics can
	be reduced even in strongly spatially autocorrelated environments.},

	Abstract = {Many biologists now recognize that environmental variance can exert
	important effects on patterns and processes in nature that are independent
	of average conditions. Jensens inequality is a mathematical proof
	that is seldom mentioned in the ecological literature but which provides
	a powerful tool for predicting some direct effects of environmental
	variance in biological systems. Qualitative predictions can be derived
	from the form of the relevant response functions (accelerating versus
	decelerating). Knowledge of the frequency distribution (especially
	the variance) of the driving variables allows quantitative estimates
	of the effects. Jensens inequality has relevance in every field
	of biology that includes nonlinear processes.},

	Abstract = {Scramble competition models of begging predict that junior nestlings
	will be more affected by food limitation than seniors. These models
	assume that food allocation is under offspring control and, hence,
	predict that this change in food distribution is caused by a differential
	behavioral response by seniors and juniors. By using the bluethroat
	(Luscinia svecica svecica) as our model species, we induced food
	limitation by removing the male parent temporarily. We found that,
	as predicted, food distribution became more biased in disfavor of
	juniors when food was limited. However, there was no significant
	difference in the behavioral responses of seniors and juniors (i.e.,
	positioning in the nest or begging postures) to food limitation that
	could explain the change in food distribution. Hence, there was no
	evidence that seniors controlled food distribution. As predicted
	if parents preferentially fed seniors, nestling rank affected food
	distribution when controlling for variation in nestling behaviors.
	Furthermore, as expected if the increased skew in food distribution
	under food limitation was caused by active food allocation by parents,
	nestling rank had a greater effect on food distribution under food
	limitation than under normal conditions. The present study suggests
	that food distribution in passerine birds is determined not only
	by nestling behaviors (begging posture and positioning) alone but
	also by parental preferences for seniors based on nonsignaling cues,
	such as body size. 01500 (Evolution ) [85548 ] Passeriformes , Aves

@article{Solberg1,
	Abstract = {Whether cohort effects can be retrieved in adult phenotypes depends
	on the possibility for individuals to compensate for a good or bad
	start in life. This ability to compensate may itself depend on the
	environment and on individual sex. In large polygynous ungulates,
	male reproductive success relies more on body size than the reproductive
	success of females, which makes them more sensitive to a bad start
	in life. Based on current theories of life history evolution and
	sexual selection, we tested the following predictions in a moose
	population: 1) cohort effects and year effects occur in both male
	and female adult body mass, but due to 2) compensatory growth, cohort
	effects tend to fade away with the individual's age; and 3) males
	are more sensitive to cohort effects than females. In support of
	the first prediction, we found that density and climate during the
	year-of-birth and the year-of-harvest affected moose body mass in
	both sexes. However, the magnitude of the effects of environmental
	conditions at birth on adult body mass decreased with increasing
	age, but less so in males than in females. Thus, as expected based
	on our third prediction, environmental conditions early in life were
	more influential on adult body mass of males compared to females.
	Such a result supports the existence of sex-specific life history
	tactics, with males maximising growth rate and females rather trading-off
	growth for reproduction. 07502 (Ecology environmental biology General

	Abstract = {Life history theory tries to explain how evolution designs organisms
	to achieve reproductive success. The design is a solution to an ecological
	problem posed by the environment and subject to constraints intrinsic
	to the organism. Work on life histories has expanded the role of
	phenotypes in evolutionary theory, extending the range of predictions
	from genetic patterns to whole-organism traits directly connected
	to fitness. Among the questions answered are the following: Why are
	organisms small or large? Why do they mature early or late? Why do
	they have few or many offspring? Why do they have a short or a long
	life? Why must they grow old and die? The classical approach to life
	histories was optimization; it has had some convincing empirical
	success. Recently non-equilibrium approaches involving frequency-dependence,
	density-dependence, evolutionary game theory, adaptive dynamics,
	and explicit population dynamics have supplanted optimization as
	the preferred approach. They have not yet had as much empirical success,
	but there are logical reasons to prefer them, and they may soon extend
	the impact of life history theory into population dynamics and interspecific
	interactions in coevolving communities.},

@article{Stpierre1,
	Abstract = {1. Dispersal plays an integral role in determining spatial population
	structure and, consequently, the long-term survival of many species.
	Theoretical studies indicate that dispersal increases with population
	density and decreasing habitat stability. In the case of monophagous
	insect herbivores, the stability of host-plant populations may influence
	their spatial population structure. 2. The tallgrass prairie in Iowa,
	U.S.A. is highly fragmented and most prairie insects face a landscape
	with fewer habitat patches and smaller host-plant populations than
	150 years ago, potentially making dispersal between patches difficult.
	Some herbivores, however, use native plant species with weedy characteristics
	that have increased in abundance because of disturbances. 3. Mark-recapture
	data and presence-absence surveys were used to examine dispersal
	and spatial population structure of two monophagous beetles with
	host plants that exhibit different population stability and have
	responded differently to fragmentation of tallgrass prairie. 4. Chrysochus
	auratus Fabricius exhibits a patchy population structure and has
	relatively large dispersal distances and frequencies. Its host plant
	is variable locally in time and space, but is more abundant than
	150 years ago. The other species, Anomoea laticlavia Forster, exhibits
	a metapopulation or non-equilibrium population structure and has
	relatively small dispersal distances and frequencies. Its host-plant
	populations are stable in time and space. 5. The results indicate
	that dispersal ability of monophagous beetles reflects the life-history
	dynamics of their host plants, but the spatial population structure
	exhibited today is strongly influenced by how the host plants have
	responded to the fragmentation process over both time and space.

	Abstract = {A model for the evolution of plasticity is considered in which the
	phenotype, undergoing stabilizing selection, is modeled as a linear
	function of an environmental cue correlated with the phenotypic optimum,
	with the coefficients z0 and z1 evolving according to standard quantitative
	genetic theory. In contrast to previous theoretical models, as the
	rate of migration between demes or the rate of cyclic fluctuations
	in the optimum increases, the amount of plasticity z1 at equilibrium
	is shown to increase gradually, in part accounting for the effect
	of reduced nonplastic adaptation and reaching a maximum equal to
	the squared correlation between the environmental cue and the phenotypic
	optimum. Given that information available to the organism is limited,
	this bias of the expressed phenotype toward the global optimum is
	still optimal, however, in a certain decision-theoretic sense. When
	genetic variation in the plastic component of the trait is small
	so that spatial or temporal differentiation in plasticity is small,
	the effect of plasticity on nonplastic adaptation is to reduce the
	effects of variation in the phenotypic optimum by a factor 1 - z1
	only. Information acquisition costs and joint evolution of sensory
	systems are discussed.},

@article{Turelli1,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates the use of heuristically derived stochastic
	differential equations (SDEs) as models in population biology. It
	is stressed that these equations are best viewed as approximations
	for more realistic, but often analytically intractable, models. A
	criterion is presented for determining which interpretation (e.g.,
	Ito or Stratonovich) is likely to serve as the most useful approximation.
	Several limit theorems are presented which illustrate the use and
	implications of this criterion. In particular, it is shown that the
	solutions to sequences of models which approach a given SDE may converge
	to a diffusion process which corresponds to no solution of the SDE.
	However, arguing that in population biology the SDEs are generally
	serving as approximations to stochastic difference equations with
	autocorrelated noise, it is shown for a variety of models that the
	Ito calculus may provide a more useful approximation than the Stratonovich.
	Important limitations of this result and on the use of SDEs are indicated.
	These findings and observations are compared with those of several
	papers in the recent literature.},

	Abstract = {Cod Gadus morhua population in the Barents Sea was found to be spatially
	structured with regard to length-at-age. Results were based on data
	collected during research surveys in the Barents Sea between 1982
	and 1997. The identified spatial structure was most pronounced for
	age groups 2-4 years and decreased for the older age groups with
	higher potential for migration. A positive linear correlation between
	mean length-at-age and mean geographical temperature was established
	for age groups 2-4 years. This correlation was shown to be strongest
	when based on mean temperatures during 3 year periods ending with
	the year of capture. The spatial structure in length-at-age was shown
	to follow the temperature gradient of the Barents Sea. A large part
	of the observed area effects could be explained by temperature variation
	between areas. Evidence is also presented which indicates that the
	predictability and sensitivity of the dependence of length-at-age
	on temperature increases under extreme environmental conditions,
	i.e. in the northern and eastern areas of the Barents Sea. 07508
