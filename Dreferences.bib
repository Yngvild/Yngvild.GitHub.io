	Abstract = {Many biologists now recognize that environmental variance can exert
	important effects on patterns and processes in nature that are independent
	of average conditions. Jensens inequality is a mathematical proof
	that is seldom mentioned in the ecological literature but which provides
	a powerful tool for predicting some direct effects of environmental
	variance in biological systems. Qualitative predictions can be derived
	from the form of the relevant response functions (accelerating versus
	decelerating). Knowledge of the frequency distribution (especially
	the variance) of the driving variables allows quantitative estimates
	of the effects. Jensens inequality has relevance in every field
	of biology that includes nonlinear processes.},
